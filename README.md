A single website which will help solve the following problems: 
Anti Social Activity:

Click photos or record videos of any anti social activity like heaps of uncollected garbage or any residential problems and post it on our website and we will make sure that the problem is communicated to the appropriate authority and is solved.

Left-Over Food Donation: Restaurants and cafeteria will be connected to appropriate ngos so that left-over food can be provided to the needy and poor people.

Educating India About Real India: To make a social change we need the support of the entire population which will happen only when people know and believe in their country and its history and culture. So, unknown facts and cultural traits of our country will be provided on our website to ignite patriotism in the youth.
